# Desc

This folder is for providers ( equivalent to ViewModel )

- Contain the states
- Consume the services

Exemple: (With provider)

class AuthProvider with ChangeNotifier {

User? user;

    User get user => _user;

    Future login (String email, String password) async {
      final AuthService authService = AuthService();
      final user = await authService.login(email,password);
      if(user != null) {
        this.user = user;
        ...
      }
      ...
    }

}
